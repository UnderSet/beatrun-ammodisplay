# beatrun-ammocounter
My attempt at making an ammo display that works well with Beatrun.

**No Spawnmenu options won't be added. Do not ask for it.**

## Features
- Primary ammo display, with viewpunch offset and all
- Secondary/alt-fire ammo display, with mag-style altfire support
- Support for mag-less weapons
- Fully clientside, works with any server that has `sv_allowcslua` allowed
- (Bonus (kinda):) 2D speedometer at the bottom, similar visually to some old Beatrun videos

## To be done
Just check the Issues tab, will ya?

<br>*No, seriously, check Issues. Please. It saves me so much time.*
