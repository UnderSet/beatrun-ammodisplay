# beatrun-ammocounter
My attempt at making an ammo display that works well with Beatrun. Options can be found under `PKAmmoDisp_`.<br>If it doesn't show up, run the following command in the Developer Console: `lua_openscript_cl autorun\ammocounter.lua`

**No, Spawnmenu options *won't* be added. Do not ask for it.**

*ArcCW is ----ing horrible to work with. Don't make SWEPs using it. (Maybe I'm just too ambitious, but still.)*

## Features
- Fully clientside, works with any server that has `sv_allowcslua` allowed
- Primary ammo display, with viewpunch offset and firemode display
- Secondary/alt-fire ammo display, with mag-style altfire support *(why does no other HUD support this properly?)*
- Support for mag-less weapons
- Armor display because Beatrun doesn't have one
- Optional speedometer, works outside of Beatrun too

## To be done
Just check the Issues tab, will ya?

<br>*No, seriously, check Issues. Please. It saves me so much time.*
