# beatrun-ammocounter
My attempt at making an ammo display that works well with Beatrun. *Currently in rewrite, is kind of usable for now.*<br>If it doesn't show up, run the following command in the Developer Console: `lua_openscript_cl autorun\client\ammocounter.lua`

*Now finally automatically loads by default!*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some weapons may register as a Modern Warfare Base weapon! This cannot be avoided with how the MW Base is programmed!

**No, Spawnmenu options *won't* be added, even in the rewrite. Do not ask for it.**

## Features
- **Now works with 4:3 aspect ratios!**
- Fully clientside, works with any server that has `sv_allowcslua` allowed
- Primary ammo display, with viewpunch offset and firemode display
- Secondary/alt-fire ammo display, with mag-style altfire support *(why does no other HUD support this properly?)*
- Support for mag-less weapons
- Armor display because Beatrun doesn't have one
- ~~Optional speedometer, works outside of Beatrun too~~

## To be done
Just check the Issues tab, will ya?

<br>*No, seriously, check Issues. Please. It saves me so much time.*
